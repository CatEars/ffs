[ ] Rotate logs

[ ] Built-in `docs` page

[ ] Automate changelog of features and fixes

	[ ] And clear cache!

[ ] Download directories

[ ] Make Command use SSE (or similar) for running commands

[ ] Side view of files when in media mode ("playlist")

[ ] Use elipsis for directory traversal and gallery/file-listing view
