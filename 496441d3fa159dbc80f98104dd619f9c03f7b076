[ ] Rotate logs

[ ] Built-in `docs` page

[ ] Add thumbnail support for more video files

[ ] Automate changelog of features and fixes

[ ] Do not use `paths` in URL to share files, as that can be quite long and max limit is 2048

[ ] For reactivity framework, ensure that single updates are topologically sorted. e.g. if one prop depends on 4 other props only 1 update not 4

[ ] Add `Config` tab that can auto-generate config for a new installation
