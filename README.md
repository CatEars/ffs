# FFS

All the different file servers I have tested have come short.

I want:

- Dead simple installation and setup. No SQL databases that need manual migrations and downtime. Looking at you NextCloud and Seafile!
- Easy and intuitive online file management. It should not be hard to move some files around. If only Apache had this functionality...
- Usable mobile web-page. Not everyone is a frontend engineer, but does it hurt to enable responsive mode in the web console?
- Good security posture. While copyparty is fun to look at from the outside. I just feel less safe looking at the inside.
- Some extensibility. I don't need an app-store, but I do need to run some basic local scripts.
